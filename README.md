# Electrofly

> Electron-powered frontend for Butterfly

Electrofly is a frontend that plugs into Butterfly using Socket.IO. Currently only one plugin command is supported (:sunglasses:), it is the `transition` command.

## Starting

 1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
 2. Issue `gulp run` to start Electrofly on its own (without Butterfly)
